(All images created with MATLAB® software)

Infinite spiral staircase-like Riemann Surface for the logarithm. The picture shows only three levels of the surface, which extends up and down with infinitely many similar levels (all joined at the branch point at the origin).

Picture obtained using the script RiemannSur in the Athena 18.04 MATLAB® Toolkit.
