Figure 1: Riemann Surface of the function f(z)=log(z{{< sup "2" >}}\-1)

To construct the **Riemann Surface for the function f(z)=log(z{{< sup "2" >}}\-1)**, we start with the complex plane with two cuts along the real axis: one for x > 1 and the other for x \< -1. Here the function has infinitely many branches. Then we proceed in the same fashion used in the previous examples. **The two pictures show two views of the resulting surface**. We note that this **Riemann Surface is an object in three dimensional space**. Furthermore, this is an example with **three branch points**, in which it differs from all the prior examples (which only had two branch points). **The branch points are z=1, z=2 and infinity**.
